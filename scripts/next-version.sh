#
# Computes the next immutable calendar version for a bedrock_website image
# release.
#
# Added as part of the Docker tag strategy work (docs/image-versioning.md):
# deployments must pin an immutable tag, and a downstream Renovate needs a
# monotonically increasing, architecture-scoped version to track. The contract
# is:
#
#     <YYYY>.<MM>.<DD>.<N>-<arch>      e.g. 2026.07.30.1-arm64
#
# The date changes whenever a rebuild happens, which is what actually moves for
# this repo: the PHP base image, its Debian packages and the Composer
# dependencies resolved by `composer update` during the build - rarely the
# source tree. <N> disambiguates multiple builds on the same day. The
# architecture suffix is consumed by Renovate as the `compatibility` group so an
# arm64 deployment is never offered an amd64 image (and vice versa).
#
# Failure handling is deliberately fail-closed: only an empty/first-ever
# repository (HTTP 404) is treated as "no tags yet". Any other non-200
# response, malformed JSON, or network failure aborts the script rather than
# silently allocating from an empty list - a wrongly "empty" listing could
# otherwise produce a version older than one that already exists (e.g. `.1`
# looks free because the listing failed to show that `.2` already exists),
# which Renovate would then never see as an update.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/next-version.sh <dockerhub-repo> <arch>
#
# Example:
#   scripts/next-version.sh anthonysautomations/bedrock_website arm64
#
# Prints the new version (without the arch suffix) to stdout. All diagnostics go
# to stderr so the caller can capture stdout directly.
